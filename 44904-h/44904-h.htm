<h2>
LECTURE I. MR. CAUDLE HAS LENT FIVE POUNDS TO A FRIEND.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>OU ought to be very rich, Mr. Caudle. I wonder who'd lend you five
pounds? But so it is: a wife may work and may slave! Ha, dear! the many
things that might have been done with five pounds! As if people picked up
money in the street! But you always were a fool, Mr. Caudle! I 've wanted
a black satin gown these three years, and that five pounds would have
pretty well bought it. But it's no matter how I go,&mdash;not at all.
Every body says I don't dress as becomes your wife&mdash;and I don't: but
what's that to you, Mr. Caudle? Nothing. Oh no! you can have fine feelings
for everybody but those belonging to you. I wish people knew you, as I do&mdash;that's
all. You like to be called liberal&mdash;and your poor family pays for it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;All the girls want bonnets, and when they're to get 'em I can't tell.
Half five pounds would have bought 'em&mdash;but now they must go without.
Of course, <i>they</i> belong to you; and anybody but your own flesh and
blood, Mr. Caudle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The man called for the water-rate, to-day; but I should like to know how
people are to pay taxes, who throw away five pounds to every fellow that
asks them.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you don't know that Jack, this morning, knocked his shuttle-cock
through his bed-room window. I was going to send for the glazier to mend
it; but after you lent that five pounds I was sure we couldn't afford it.
Oh, no! the window must go as it is; and pretty weather for a dear child
to sleep with a broken window. He's got a cold already on his lungs, and I
shouldn't at all wonder if that broken window settled him&mdash;if the
dear boy dies, his death will be upon his father's head; for I'm sure we
can't now pay to mend windows. We might though, and do a good many more
things, if people didn't throw away their five pounds.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Next Tuesday the fire-insurance is due. I should like to know how it's to
be paid! Why, it can't be paid at all. That five pounds would have just
done it&mdash;and now, insurance is out of the question. And there never
were so many fires as there are now. I shall never close my eyes all
night,&mdash;but what's that to you, so people can call you liberal Mr.
Caudle '? Your wife and children may all be burnt alive in their beds&mdash;as
all of us to a certainty shall be, for the insurance <i>must</i> drop. And
after we've insured for so many years! But how, I should like to know, are
people to insure who make ducks and drakes of their five pounds?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I did think we might go to Margate this summer. There's poor little
Caroline, I'm sure she wants the sea. But no, dear creature! she must stop
at home&mdash;all of us must stop at home&mdash;she'll go into a
consumption, there's no doubt of that; yes&mdash;sweet little angel!&mdash;I've
made up my mind to lose her, <i>now</i>. The child might have been saved;
but people can't save their children and throw away their five pounds too.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wonder where poor little Cherub is! While you were lending that five
pounds, the dog ran out of the shop. You know, I never let it go into the
street, for fear it should be bit by some mad dog, and come home and bite
all the children. It wouldn't now at all astonish me if the animal was to
come back with the hydrophobia and give it to all the family. However,
what's your family to you, so you can play the liberal creature with five
pounds?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you hear that shutter, how it's banging to and fro? Yes,&mdash;I know
what it wants as well as you, it wants a new fastening. I was going to
send for the blacksmith to-day. But now it's out of the question: <i>now</i>
it must bang of nights, since you've thrown away five pounds.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, things are come to a pretty pass! This is the first night I ever
made my supper off roast beef without pickles. But who is to afford
pickles when folks are always lending five pounds?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ha! there's the soot falling down the chimney. If I hate the smell of
anything, it's the smell of soot. And you know it; but what are my
feelings to you? Sweep the chimney! Yes, it's all very fine to say, sweep
the chimney&mdash;but how are chimneys to be swept&mdash;how are they to
be paid for by people who don't take care of their five pounds?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you hear the mice running about the room? <i>I</i> hear them. If they
were only to drag you out of bed, it would be no matter. Set a trap for
them! Yes, it's easy enough to say&mdash;set a trap for 'em. But how are
people to afford the cheese, when every day they lose five pounds?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Hark! I'm sure there's a noise down stairs. It wouldn't at all surprise
me if there were thieves in the house. Well, it <i>may</i> be the cat; but
thieves are pretty sure to come in some night. There's a wretched
fastening to the back-door; but these are not times to afford bolts and
bars, when fools wont take care of their five pounds.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Mary Anne ought to have gone to the dentist's to-morrow. She wants three
teeth taken out. Now, it can't be done. Three teeth that quite disfigure
the child's mouth. But there they must stop, and spoil the sweetest face
that was ever made. Otherwise, she'd have been a wife for a lord. Now,
when she grows up, who'll have her? Nobody. We shall die, and leave her
alone and unprotected in the world. But what do you care for that?
Nothing; so you can squander away five pounds.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now, see, Mr. Caudle, what a misery you've brought upon your wretched
family! I can't have a satin gown&mdash;the girls can't have new bonnets&mdash;the
water-rate must stand over&mdash;Jack must get his death through a broken
window&mdash;our fire-insurance can't be paid, so we shall all fall
victims to the devouring element&mdash;we can't go to Margate, and
Caroline will go to an early grave&mdash;the dog will come home and bite
us all mad&mdash;that shutter will go banging for ever&mdash;the soot will
always fall&mdash;the mice never let us have a wink of sleep&mdash;thieves
be always breaking in the house&mdash;and our dear Mary Anne be for ever
left an unprotected maid,&mdash;and all, all, Mr. Caudle, because <i>YOU
WILL GO ON LENDING FIVE POUNDS!</i>&rdquo;

<p>
OOR me! Ha! I 'm sure I don't know who'd be a poor woman! I don't know
who'd tie themselves up to a man, if they knew only half they'd have to
bear. A wife must stay at home, and be a drudge, whilst a man can go
anywhere. It's enough for a wife to sit like Cinderella by the ashes,
whilst her husband can go drinking and singing at a tavern. You never
sing! How do I know you never sing? It's very well for you to say so; but
if I could hear you, I dare say you're among the worst of 'em.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And now, I suppose, it will be the tavern every night. If you think I'm
going to sit up for you, Mr. Caudle, you 're very much mistaken. No: and
I'm not going to get out of my warm bed to let you in, either. No: nor
Susan shan't sit up for you. No: nor you shan't have a latch-key. I'm not
going to sleep with the door upon the latch, to be murdered before the
morning.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Faugh! Pah! Whewgh! That filthy tobacco smoke! It's enough to kill any
decent woman. You know I hate tobacco, and yet you will do it. You don't
smoke yourself! What of that? If you go among people who <i>do</i> smoke,
you 're just as bad, or worse. You might as well smoke&mdash;indeed,
better. Better smoke yourself than come home with other people's smoke in
your hair.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I never knew any good come to a man who went to a tavern. Nice companions
he picks up there! Yes; people who make it a boast to treat their wives
like slaves, and ruin their families. There's that wretch, Prettyman. See
what he's come to. He doesn't now get home till two in the morning; and
then in what a state! He begins quarrelling with the door-mat, that his
poor wife may be afraid to speak to him. A mean wretch! But don't you
think I'll be like Mrs. Prettyman. No: I wouldn't put up with it from the
best man that ever trod. You 'll not make me afraid to speak to you,
however you may swear at the door-mat. No, Mr. Caudle, that you won't.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You don't intend to stay out till two in the morning! How do you know
what you 'll do when you get among such people? Men can't answer for
themselves when they get boozing one with another. They never think of
their poor wives, who are grieving and wearing themselves out at home. A
nice headache you 'll have tomorrow morning&mdash;or rather <i>this</i>
morning; for it must be past twelve. You won't have a headache! It 's very
well for you to say so, but I know you will; and then you may nurse
yourself for me. Ha! that filthy tobacco again! No: I shall not go to
sleep like a good soul! How's people to go to sleep when they 're
suffocated?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Caudle, you'll be nice and ill in the morning! But don't you
think I'm going to let you have your breakfast in bed, like Mrs.
Pretty-man. I'll not be such a fool. No: nor I won't have discredit
brought upon the house by sending for soda-water early, for all the
neighbourhood to say, 'Caudle was drunk last night!' No: I've some regard
for the dear children, if you havn't. No: nor you shan't have broth for
dinner. Not a neck of mutton crosses my threshold, I can tell you.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You won't want soda, and you won't want broth! All the better. You
wouldn't get 'em if you did, I can assure you.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Dear,
dear, dear! That filthy tobacco! I'm sure it's enough to make me as bad as
you are. Talking about getting divorced,&mdash;I'm sure tobacco ought to
be good grounds. How little does a woman think when she marries, that she
gives herself up to be poisoned! You men contrive to have it all of your
own side, you do. Now if I was to go and leave you and the children, a
pretty noise there'd be! You, however, can go and smoke no end of pipes&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
You didn't smoke! It's all the same, Mr. Caudle, if you go among smoking
people. Folks are known by their company. You'd better smoke yourself,
than bring me home the pipes of all the world.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I see how it will be. Now you 've once gone to a tavern, you 'll
always be going. You 'll be coming home tipsy every night; and tumbling
down and breaking your leg, and putting out your shoulder; and bringing
all sorts of disgrace and expense upon us. And then you 'll be getting
into a street fight&mdash;oh! I know your temper too well to doubt it, Mr.
Caudle&mdash;and be knocking down some of the police. And then I know what
will follow. It <i>must</i> follow. Yes, you 'll be sent for a month or
six weeks to the treadmill. Pretty thing that, for a respectable
tradesman, Mr. Caudle, to be put upon the treadmill with all sorts of
thieves and vagabonds, and&mdash;there, again, that horrible tobacco!&mdash;and
riff-raff of every kind. I should like to know how your children are to
hold up their heads, after their father has been upon the treadmill?&mdash;&mdash;
No: I <i>won't</i> go to sleep. And I'm not talking of what's impossible.
I know it will all happen&mdash;every bit of it. If it wasn't for the dear
children, you might be ruined and I wouldn't so much as speak about it,
but&mdash;oh, dear, dear! at least you might go where they smoke <i>good</i>
tobacco&mdash;but I can't forget that I'm their mother. At least, they
shall have <i>one</i> parent.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Taverns! Never did a man go to a tavern who didn't die a beggar. And how
your pot-companions will laugh at you when they see your name in the <i>Gazette!</i>
For it <i>must</i> happen. Your business is sure to fall off; for what
respectable people will buy toys for their children of a drunkard? You 're
not a drunkard! No: but you will be&mdash;it's all the same.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You've begun by staying out till midnight. By-and-by 't will be all
night. But don't you think, Mr. Caudle, you shall ever have a key. I know
you. Yes; you'd do exactly like that Prettyman, and what did he do, only
last Wednesday? Why, he let himself in about four in the morning, and
brought home with him his pot-companion. His dear wife woke at six, and
saw Prettyman's dirty boots at her bed-side. And where was the wretch, her
husband? Why, he was drinking down stairs&mdash;swilling. Yes; worse than
a midnight robber, he'd taken the keys out of his dear wife's pockets&mdash;ha!
what that poor creature has to bear!&mdash;and had got at the brandy. A
pretty thing for a wife to wake at six in the morning, and instead of her
husband to see his dirty boots!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I 'll not be made your victim, Mr. Caudle, not I. You shall never get
at my keys, for they shall lie under my pillow&mdash;under my own head,
Mr. Caudle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You'll be ruined, but if I can help it, you shall ruin nobody but
yourself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh! that hor&mdash;hor&mdash;hor&mdash;i&mdash;ble tob&mdash;ac&mdash;co!&rdquo;

<h2>
LECTURE III. MR. CAUDLE JOINS A CLUB,&mdash;&ldquo;THE SKYLARKS.&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>'M sure a poor woman had better be in her grave than married! That is,
if she can't be married to a decent man! No: I don't care if you are
tired, I <i>shan't</i>, let you go to sleep. No, and I won't say what I
have to say in the morning; I'll say it now. It's all very well for you to
come home at what time you like&mdash;it's now half-past twelve&mdash;and
expect I'm to hold my tongue, and let you go to sleep. What next, I
wonder? A woman had better be sold for a slave at once.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so you've gone and joined a club! The Skylarks, indeed! A pretty
skylark you 'll make of yourself! But I won't stay and be ruined by you.
No: I'm determined of that. I 'll go and take the dear children, and you
may get who you like to keep your house. That is, as long as you have a
house to keep&mdash;and that won't be long, know.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How any decent man can go and spend his nights in a tavern!&mdash;oh,
yes, Mr. Caudle; I dare say you <i>do</i> go for rational conversation. I
should like to know how many of you would care for what you call rational
conversation, if you had it without your filthy brandy-and-water; yes, and
your more filthy tobacco-smoke. I'm sure the last time you came home, I
had the head-ache for a week. But I know who it is who's taking you to
destruction. It's that brute, Prettyman. He has broken his own poor wife's
heart, and now he wants to&mdash;but don't you think it, Mr. Caudle; I'll
not have my peace of mind destroyed by the best man that ever trod. Oh,
yes! I know you don't care so long as you can appear well to all the
world,&mdash;but the world little thinks how you behave to me. It shall
know it, though&mdash;that I'm determined.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How any man can leave his own happy fireside to go and sit, and smoke,
and drink, and talk with people who wouldn't one of 'em lift a finger to
save him from hanging&mdash;how any man can leave his wife&mdash;and a
good wife, too, though I say it&mdash;for a parcel of pot-companions&mdash;oh,
it's disgraceful, Mr. Caudle: it's unfeeling. No man who had the least
love for his wife could do it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I suppose this is to be the case every Saturday? But I know what I
'll do. I know&mdash;it's no use, Mr. Caudle, your calling me a good
creature: I'm not such a fool as to be coaxed in that way. No: if you want
to go to sleep, you should come home in Christian time, not at halfpast
twelve. There was a time, when you were as regular at your fireside as the
kettle. That was when you were a decent man, and didn't go amongst, Heaven
knows who, drinking and smoking, and making what you think your jokes. I
never heard any good come to a man who cared about jokes. No respectable
tradesman does. But I know what I'll do: I'll scare away your Skylarks.
The house serves liquor after twelve of a Saturday; and if I don't write
to the magistrates, and have the license taken away, I'm not lying in this
bed this night. Yes, you may call me a foolish woman; but no, Mr. Caudle,
no; it's you who are the foolish man: or worse than a foolish man; you 're&mdash;a
wicked one. If you were to die to-morrow&mdash;and people who go to
public-houses do all they can to shorten their lives&mdash;I should like
to know who would write upon your tombstone, 'A tender husband and an
affectionate father.' I&mdash;I'd have no such falsehoods told of you, I
can assure you.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Going and spending your money, and&mdash;nonsense! don't tell me&mdash;no,
if you were to ten times swear it, I wouldn't believe that you only spent
eighteen-pence on a Saturday. You can't be all those hours, and only spend
eighteen-pence. I know better. I'm not quite a fool, Mr. Caudle. A great
deal you could have for eighteen-pence! And all the Club married men and
fathers of families. The more shame for 'em! Skylarks, indeed! They should
call themselves Vultures; for they can only do as they do by robbing their
innocent wives and children. Eighteen-pence a week! And if it was only
that,&mdash;do you know what fifty-two eighteen-pences come to in a year?
Do you ever think of that, and see the gowns I wear? I'm sure I can't, out
of the house-money, buy myself a pincushion; though I've wanted one these
six months. No&mdash;not so much as a ball of cotton.&rdquo; But what do you
care, so you can get your brandy-and-water? There's the girls, top&mdash;the
things they want! They are never dressed like other people's children. But
it's all the same to their father. Oh, yes! So he can go with his
Skylarks, they may wear sackcloth for pinafores, and packthread for
garters.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You'd better not let that Mr. Prettyman come here, that's all; or,
rather, you'd better bring him once. Yes, I should like to see him. He
wouldn't forget it. A man who, I may say, lives and moves only in a
spittoon. A man who has a pipe in his mouth as constant as his front
teeth. A sort of tavern king, with a lot of fools, like you, to laugh at
what lie thinks his jokes, and give him consequence. No, Mr. Caudle, no;
it's no use your telling me to go to sleep, for I won't. Go to sleep,
indeed! I'm sure it's almost time to get up. I hardly know what's the use
of coming to bed at all now.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The Skylarks, indeed! I suppose you 'll be buying a 'Little Warbler,' and
at your time of life, be trying to sing. The peacocks will sing next. A
pretty name you 'll get in the neighbourhood; and, in a very little time,
a nice face you 'll have. Your nose is getting redder already: and you've
just one of the noses that liquor always flies to. You don't see it's red?
No&mdash;I dare say not&mdash;but I see it; I see a great many things-you
don't. And so you 'll go on. In a little time, with your brandy-and-water&mdash;don't
tell me that you only take two small glasses; I know what men's two small
glasses are; in a little time you'll have a face all over as if it was
made of red currant jam. And I should like to know who's to endure you
then? I won't, and so don't think it. Don't come to me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nice habits men learn at clubs! There's Joskins: he was a decent creature
once, and now I'm told he has more than once boxed his wife's ears. He's a
Skylark, too. And I suppose, some day, you 'll be trying to box <i>my</i>
ears? Don't attempt it, Mr. Caudle; I say, don't attempt it. Yes&mdash;it's
all very well for you to say you don't mean it,&mdash;but I only say
again, don't attempt it. You'd rue it till the day of your death, Mr.
Caudle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Going and sitting for four hours at a tavern! What men, unless they had
their wives with them, can find to talk about, I can't think. No good, of
course.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Eighteen-pence a week&mdash;and drinking brandy-and-water, enough to swim
a boat! And smoking like the funnel of a steam-ship! And I can't afford
myself so much as a piece of tape! It's brutal, Mr. Caudle. It's ve-ve-ve&mdash;ry
bru&mdash;tal.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
And, says a note in the MS. by Mr. Caudle&mdash;&ldquo;Here, thank heaven!
yawning, she fell asleep.&rdquo;

LECTURE IV. MR. CAUDLE HAS BEEN CALLED FROM HIS BED TO BAIL MR. PRETTYMAN

IE, Mr. Caudle, I knew it would come to this. I said it would, when you
joined those precious Skylarks. People being called out of their beds at
all hours of the night to bail a set of fellows who are never so happy as
when they 're leading sober men to destruction. I should like to know what
the neighbours will think of you, with people from the police knocking at
the door at two in the morning. Don't tell me that the man has been
ill-used: he's not the man to be ill-used. And you must go and bail him. I
know the end of that: he 'll run away, and you 'll have to pay the money.
I should like to know what's the use of my working and slaving to save a
farthing, when you throw away pounds upon your precious Skylarks. A pretty
cold you 'll have to-morrow morning, being called out of your warm bed
this weather; but don't you think I'll nurse you&mdash;not I; not a drop
of gruel do you get from me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm sure you've plenty of ways of spending your money&mdash;not throwing
it away upon a set of dissolute peace-breakers. It's all very well for you
to say you haven't thrown away your money, but you will. He 'll be certain
to run off; it isn't likely he 'll go upon his trial, and you 'll be fixed
with the bail. Don't tell me there's no trial in the matter, because I
know there is; it's for something more than quarrelling with the policeman
that he was locked up. People ain't locked up for that. No, it's for
robbery, or something worse, perhaps.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And as you've bailed him, people will think you are as bad as he is.
Don't tell me you couldn't help bailing him; you should have shown
yourself a respectable man, and have let him been sent to prison.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now people know you 're the friend of drunken and other disorderly
persons, you 'll never have a night's sleep in your bed. Not that it would
matter what fell upon you, if it wasn't your poor wife who suffered. Of
course all the business will be in the newspapers, and your name with it.
I shouldn't wonder, too, if they give your picture as they do the other
folks of the Old Bailey. A pretty thing that, to go down to your children.
I'm sure it will be enough to make them change their name. No, I shall not
go to sleep; it's all very well for you to say, go to sleep, after such a
disturbance. I shall not go&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
But here, says Mr. Caudle's manuscript, happily she slumbered; for Mr.
Caudle had, considering the theme she had to talk upon, a remarkably short
lecture.

<p>
pretty time of night to come to bed, Mr. Caudle. Ugh! As cold, too, as any
ice. Enough to give any woman her death, I'm sure. What! I shouldn't have
locked up the coals, indeed? If I hadn't, I've no doubt the fellow would
have staid all night. It's all very well for you, Mr. Caudle, to bring
people home,&mdash;but I wish you'd think first what's for supper. That
beautiful leg of pork would have served for our dinner to-morrow,&mdash;and
now it's gone. <i>I</i> can't keep the house upon the money, and I won't
pretend to do it, if you bring a mob of people every night to clear the
cupboard.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I wonder who'll be so ready to give you a supper when you want one; for
want one you will, unless you change your plans. Don't tell me! I know I'm
right. You'll first be eaten up, and then you 'll be laughed at. I know
the world. No, indeed, Mr. Caudle, I don't think ill of everybody; don't
say that. But I can't see a leg of pork eaten up in that way, without
asking myself what it's all to end in if such things go on? And then he
must have pickles, too! Couldn't be content with my cabbage&mdash;no, Mr.
Caudle, I won't let you go to sleep. It's very well for you to say let you
go to sleep, after you've kept me awake till this time. <i>Why</i> did I
keep awake? How do you suppose I could go to sleep, when I knew that man
was below drinking up your substance in brandy-and-water? for he couldn't
be content upon decent, wholesome gin. Upon my word, you ought to be a
rich man, Mr. Caudle. You have such very fine friends. I wonder who gives
you brandy when you go out!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, he couldn't be content with my pickled cabbage&mdash;and I
should like to know who makes better&mdash;but he must have walnuts. And
you, too, like a fool&mdash;now, don't you think to stop me, Mr. Caudle; a
poor woman may be trampled to death, and never say a word&mdash;you, too,
like a fool&mdash;I wonder who'd do it for you&mdash;to insist upon the
girl going out for pickled walnuts. And in such a night too! With snow
upon the ground. Yes; you're a man of fine feelings, you are, Mr. Caudle!
but the world doesn't know you as I know you&mdash;fine feelings, indeed!
to send the poor girl out, when I told you and told your friend too&mdash;a
pretty brute he is, I'm sure&mdash;that the poor girl had got a cold and
chilblains on her toes But I know what will be the end of that; she 'll be
laid up, and we shall have a nice doctor's bill And you 'll pay it, I can
tell you&mdash;for <i>I</i> wont.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wish you were out of the world? Oh! yes, that's all very easy, I'm sure
<i>I</i> might wish it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't swear in that dreadful way! Ain't you afraid that the bed will open
and swallow you? And don't swing about in that way. <i>That</i> will do no
good. <i>That</i> won't bring back the leg of pork,&mdash;and the brandy
you've poured down both of your throats. Oh, I know it! I'm sure of it. I
only recollected it when I'd got into bed,&mdash;and if it hadn't been so
cold, you'd have seen me down stairs again, I can tell you&mdash;I
recollected it, and a pretty two hours I've passed, that I left the key in
the cupboard,&mdash;and I knew it&mdash;I could see by the manner of you,
when you came into the room&mdash;I know you've got the other bottle.
However, there's one comfort: you told me to send for the best brandy&mdash;the
very best&mdash;for your other friend, who called last Wednesday. Ha! ha!
It was British&mdash;the cheapest British&mdash;and nice and ill I hope
the pair of you will be tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's only the bare bone of the leg of pork: but you'll get nothing
else for dinner, I can tell you. It's a dreadful thing that the poor
children should go without,&mdash;but, if they have such a father, they,
poor things, must suffer for it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nearly a whole leg of pork and a pint of brandy! A pint of brandy and a
leg of pork. A leg of&mdash;leg&mdash;leg-pint&mdash;&rdquo;

<h2>
LECTURE VI. MR. CAUDLE HAS LENT AN ACQUAINTANCE THE FAMILY UMBRELLA. MRS.
CAUDLE LECTURES THEREON.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>AH! That's the third umbrella gone since Christmas. What were you to do!
Why let him go home in the rain, to be sure. I'm very certain there was
nothing about <i>him</i> that could spoil. Take cold, indeed! He doesn't
look like one of the sort to take cold. Besides he'd have better taken
cold than take our only umbrella. Do you hear the rain, Mr. Caudle? I say,
do you hear the rain? And as I'm alive, if it isn't Saint Swithin's day!
Do you hear it against the windows? Nonsense; you don't impose upon me.
You can't be asleep with such a shower as that! Do you hear it, I say? Oh
you <i>do</i> hear it! Well, that's a pretty flood, I think, to last for
six weeks; and no stirring all the time out of the house. Pooh! Don't
think me a fool, Mr. Caudle. Don't insult me. <i>He</i> return the
umbrella! Any body would think you were born yesterday. As if anybody ever
<i>did</i> return an umbrella! There&mdash;do you hear it? Worse and
worse! Cats and dogs, and for six weeks&mdash;always six weeks. And no
umbrella!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I should like to know how the children are to get to school to-morrow.
They shan't go through such weather, I'm determined. No: they shall stop
at home and never learn anything&mdash;the blessed creatures!&mdash;sooner
than go and get wet. And when they grow up, I wonder who they 'll have to
thank for knowing nothing&mdash;who, indeed, but their father? People who
can't feel for their own children ought never to be fathers.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I know why you lent the umbrella. Oh, yes; I know very well. I was
going out to tea at dear mother's to-morrow,&mdash;you knew that; and you
did it on purpose. Don't tell me; you hate me to go there, and take every
mean advantage to hinder me. But don't you think it, Mr. Caudle. No, sir;
if it comes down in buckets-full, I 'll go all the more. No: and I won't
have a cab! Where do you think the money's to come from? You've got nice
high notions at that club of yours! A cab, indeed! Cost me sixteenpence at
least&mdash;sixteenpence!&mdash;two-and-eightpence, for there's back
again! Cabs, indeed! I should like to know who's to pay for 'em? <i>I</i>
can't pay for 'em; and I'm sure <i>you</i> can't, if you go on as you do;
throwing away your property, and beggaring your children&mdash;buying
umbrellas?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Do you hear the rain, Mr. Caudle? I say do you hear it? But I don't care&mdash;I
'll go to mother's to-morrow: I will; and what's more, I 'll walk every
step of the way,&mdash;and you know that will give me my death. Don't call
me a foolish woman&mdash;it's you that's the foolish man. You know can't
wear clogs; and with no umbrella, that's sure to give me a cold&mdash;it
always does. But what do you care for that? Nothing at all. I may be laid
up for what you care, as I dare say I shall&mdash;and a pretty doctor's
bill there 'll be. I hope there will! It will teach you to lend your
umbrellas again I shouldn't wonder if I caught my death; yes: and that's
what you lent the umbrella for. Of course.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Nice clothes, I shall get too, traipsing through weather like this. My
gown and bonnet will be spoilt quite. Needn't I wear 'em then? Indeed, Mr.
Caudle, I <i>shall</i> wear 'em. No, sir, I'm not going out a dowdy to
please you or anybody else. Gracious knows! it isn't often that I step
over the threshold; indeed, I might as well be a slave at once,&mdash;better,
I should say. But when I do go out, Mr. Caudle, I choose to go as a lady.
Oh! that rain&mdash;if it isn't enough to break in the windows.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ugh! I do look forward with dread for tomorrow. How I am to go to
mother's I'm sure I can't tell. But if I die, I 'll do it. No, sir; I
won't borrow an umbrella. No; and you shan't buy one. (<i>With great
emphasis.</i>) Mr. Caudle, if you bring home another umbrella, I 'll throw
it in the street. I 'll have my own umbrella or none at all.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ha! and it was only last week I had a new nozzle put to that umbrella.
I'm sure if I'd have known as much as I do now, it might have gone without
one for me. Paying for new nozzles, for other people to laugh at you. Oh,
it's all very well for you&mdash;you can go to sleep. You've no thought of
your poor patient wife, and your own dear children. You think of nothing
but lending umbrellas!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Men, indeed!&mdash;Call themselves lords of the creation!&mdash;pretty
lords when they can't take care of an umbrella!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I know that walk to-morrow will be the death of me. But that's what you
want&mdash;then you may go to your club, and do as you like&mdash;and
then, nicely my poor dear children will be used&mdash;but then, sir, then
you 'll be happy. Oh, don't tell me! I know you will. Else you'd never
have lent the umbrella!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You have to go on Thursday about that summons; and, of course, you can't
go. No, indeed, you <i>don't</i> go without the umbrella. You may lose the
debt for what I care&mdash;it won't be so much as spoiling your clothes&mdash;better
lose it: people deserve to lose debts who lend umbrellas.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I should like to know how I'm to go to mother's without the umbrella?
Oh, don't tell me that I said I <i>would</i> go&mdash;that's nothing to do
with it; nothing at all. She 'll think I'm neglecting her, and the little
money we were to have, we shan't have at all&mdash;because we've no
umbrella.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The children, too! Dear things! They 'll be sopping wet: for they shan't
stop at home&mdash;&mdash;they shan't lose their learning; it's all their
father will leave 'em, I'm sure. But they <i>shall</i> go to school. Don't
tell me I said they shouldn't: you are so aggravating, Caudle; you'd spoil
the temper of an angel. They <i>shall</i> go to school; mark that. And if
they get their deaths of cold, it's not my fault&mdash;<i>I</i> didn't
lend the umbrella.&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says Caudle in his MS, &ldquo;I fell asleep; and dreamt that the sky was
turned into green calico, with whalebone ribs; that, in fact, the whole
world revolved under a tremendous umbrella!&rdquo;

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> wonder what it will be next! There's nothing proper, now&mdash;nothing
at all. Better get somebody else to keep the house I think. I can't do it
now, it seems; I'm only in the way here: I'd better take the children, and
go.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What am I grumbling about now? It's very well for you to ask that! I'm
sure I'd better be out of the world than&mdash;there now, Mr. Caudle;
there you are again! I <i>shall</i> speak, sir. It isn't often I open my
mouth, heaven knows! But you like to hear nobody talk but yourself. You
ought to have married a negro slave, and not any respectable woman.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You 're to go about the house looking like thunder all the day, and I'm
not to say a word. Where do you think pudding's to come from every-day?
You show a nice example to your children, you do; complaining, and turning
your nose up at a sweet piece of cold mutton, because there's no pudding!
You go a nice way to make 'em extravagant&mdash;teach 'em nice lessons to
begin the world with. Do you know what puddings cost; or do you think they
fly in at the window?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You hate cold mutton. The more shame for you, Mr. Caudle. I'm sure you've
the stomach of a lord, you have. No, sir; I didn't choose to hash the
mutton. It's very easy for you to say hash it; but <i>I</i> know what a
joint loses in hashing: it's a day's dinner the less, if it's a bit. Yes,
I dare say; other people may have puddings with cold mutton. No doubt of
it; and other people become bankrupts. But if ever you get into the
Gazette, it shan't be <i>my</i> fault&mdash;no; I'll do my duty as a wife
to you, Mr. Caudle; you shall never have it to say that it was <i>my</i>
housekeeping that brought you to beggary. No; you may sulk at the cold
meat&mdash;ha! I hope you 'll never live to want such a piece of cold
mutton as we had to-day! And you may threaten to go to a tavern to dine;
but with our present means, not a crumb of pudding do you get from me. You
shall have nothing but the cold joint&mdash;nothing as I'm a Christian
sinner.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes; there you are, throwing those fowls in my face again! I know you
once brought home a pair of fowls; I know it; and wern't you mean enough
to want to stop 'em out of my week's money? Oh, the selfishness&mdash;the
shabbiness of men! They can go out and throw away pounds upon pounds with
a pack of people who laugh at 'em afterwards; but if it's anything wanted
for their own homes, their poor wives may hunt for it. I wonder you don't
blush to name those fowls again! I wouldn't be so little for the world,
Mr. Caudle!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What are you going to do? Going to get up? Don't make yourself
ridiculous, Mr. Caudle; I can't say a word to you like any other wife, but
you must threaten to get up. <i>Do</i> be ashamed of yourself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Puddings, indeed! Do you think I'm made of puddings? Didn't you have some
boiled rice three weeks ago? Besides, is this the time of the year for
puddings? It's all very well if I had money enough allowed me like any
other wife to keep the house with; then, indeed, I might have preserves,
like any other woman; now, it's impossible; and it's cruel&mdash;yes, Mr.
Caudle, cruel&mdash;of you to expect it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Apples arn't so dear, arn't they? I know what apples are, Mr. Caudle,
without your telling me. But I suppose you want something more than apples
for dumplings? I suppose sugar costs something, doesn't it? And that's how
it is. That's how one expense brings on another, and that's how people go
to ruin.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pancakes! What's the use of your lying muttering there about pancakes?
Don't you always have 'em once a-year&mdash;every Shrove Tuesday? And what
would any moderate, decent man want more?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Pancakes, indeed! Pray, Mr. Caudle,&mdash;no, it's no use your saying
fine words to me to let you go to sleep; I shan't!&mdash;pray do you know
the price of eggs just now? There's not an egg you can trust to under
seven and eight a shilling; well, you've only just to reckon up how many
eggs&mdash;don't lie swearing there at the eggs, in that manner, Mr.
Caudle; unless you expect the bed to open under you. You call yourself a
respectable tradesman, I suppose! Ha! I only wish people knew you as well
as I do! Swearing at eggs, indeed! But I'm tired of this usage, Mr.
Caudle; quite tired of it; and I don't care how soon it's ended!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm sure I do nothing but work and labour, and think how to make the most
of everything; and this is how I'm rewarded. I should like to see anybody
whose joints go further than mine. But if I was to throw away your money
into the street, or lay it out in fine feathers on myself, I should be
better thought of. The woman who studies her husband and her family is
always made a drudge of. It's your fine fal-lal wives who've the best time
of it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What's the use of your lying groaning there in that manner? That won't
make me hold my tongue, I can tell you. You think to have it all your own
way&mdash;but you won't, Mr. Caudle! You can insult my dinner; look like a
demon, I may say, at a wholesome piece of cold mutton&mdash;ha! the
thousands of far better creatures than you are who'd been thankful for
that mutton!&mdash;and I'm never to speak! But you 're mistaken&mdash;I
will! Your usage of me, Mr. Caudle, is infamous&mdash;unworthy of a man. I
only wish people knew you for what you are; but they shall, some day.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Puddings! And now I suppose I shall hear of nothing but puddings! Yes,
and I know what it would end in. First, you'd have a pudding every day;&mdash;oh,
I know your extravagance&mdash;then you'd go for fish&mdash;then I
shouldn't wonder if you'd have soup; turtle, no doubt: then you'd go for a
dessert; and&mdash;oh! I see it all as plain as the quilt before me&mdash;but
no! not while I live! What your second wife may do, I don't know; perhaps
she'll be a fine lady; but you shan't be ruined by me, Mr. Caudle; that
I'm determined. Puddings, indeed! Pu-dding-s! Pudd&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Exhausted nature,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;could hold no longer. Here my wife went
to sleep.&rdquo;

<h2>
LECTURE VIII. CAUDLE HAS BEEN MADE A MASON.&mdash;MRS. CAUDLE INDIGNANT
AND CURIOUS.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OW, Mr. Caudle&mdash;Mr. Caudle, I say: oh! you can't be asleep already,
I know&mdash;Now, what I mean to say is this; there's no use, none at all,
in our having any disturbance about the matter; but, at last my mind's
made up, Mr. Caudle; I shall leave you. Either I know all you've been
doing to-night, or to-morrow morning I quit the house. No, no; there's an
end of the marriage-state, I think&mdash;an end of all confidence between
man and wife&mdash;if a husband's to have secrets and keep 'em all to
himself. Pretty secrets they must be, when his own wife can't know 'em.
Not fit for any decent person to know, I'm sure, if that's the case. Now,
Caudle, don't let us quarrel; there's a good soul, tell me what's it all
about? A pack of nonsense, I dare say; still&mdash;not that I care much
about it&mdash;still, I <i>should</i> like to know. There's a dear: Eh?
Oh, don't tell me there's nothing in it; I know better. I'm not a fool,
Mr. Caudle; I know there's a good deal in it. Now, Caudle, just tell me a
little bit of it. I'm sure I'd tell you anything. You know I would. Well?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Caudle, you're enough to vex a saint! Now, don't you think you're going
to sleep; because you 're not. Do you suppose I'd ever suffered you to go
and be made a mason, if I didn't suppose I was to know the secret, too?
Not that it's anything to know, I dare say; and that s why I'm determined
to know it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I know what it is; oh yes, there can be no doubt. The secret is, to
ill-use poor women; to tyrannize over 'em; to make 'em your slaves;
especially your wives. It must be something of the sort, or you wouldn't
be ashamed to have it known. What's right and proper never need be done in
secret. It's an insult to a woman for a man to be a free-mason, and let
his wife know nothing of it. But, poor soul! she's sure to know it somehow&mdash;for
nice husbands they all make. Yes, yes; a part of the secret is to think
better of all the world than their own wives and families. I'm sure men
have quite enough to care for&mdash;that is, if they act properly&mdash;to
care for them they have at home. They can't have much care to spare for
the world besides.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I suppose they call you <i>Brother</i> Caudle? A pretty brother,
indeed! Going and dressing yourself up in an apron, like a turnpike man&mdash;for
that's what you look like. And I should like to know what the apron's for?
There must be something in it not very respectable, I'm sure. Well, I only
wish I was Queen for a day or two. I'd put an end to free-masonry, and all
such trumpery, I know.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, come, Caudle, don't let's quarrel. Eh! You 're not in pain, dear?
What's it all about? What are you lying laughing there at? But I'm a fool
to trouble my head about you.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And you're not going to let me know the secret, eh? You mean to say,&mdash;you're
not? Now, Caudle, you know it's a hard matter to put me in a passion&mdash;not
that I care about the secret itself: no, I wouldn't give a button to know
it, for it's all nonsense, I'm sure. It isn't the secret I care about:
it's the slight, Mr. Caudle; it's the studied insult that a man pays to
his wife, when he thinks of going through the world keeping something to
himself which he won't let her know. Man and wife one, indeed! I should
like to know how that can be when a man's a mason&mdash;when he keeps a
secret that sets him and his wife apart? Ha, you men make the laws, and so
you take good care to have all the best of 'em to yourselves; otherwise a
woman ought to be allowed a divorce when a man becomes a mason. When he's
got a sort of corner-cupboard in his heart&mdash;a secret place in his
mind&mdash;that his poor wife isn't allowed to rummage!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Caudle, you shan't close your eyes for a week&mdash;no, you shan't&mdash;unless
you tell me some, of it. Come, there's a good creature; there's a love.
I'm sure, Caudle, I wouldn't refuse you anything&mdash;and you know it, or
ought to know it by this time. I only wish I had a secret! To whom should
I think of confiding it, but to my dear husband? I should be miserable to
keep it to myself, and you know it. Now, Caudle!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Was there ever such a man? A man, indeed! A brute!&mdash;yes, Mr. Caudle,
an unfeeling, brutal creature, when you might oblige me, and you won't.
I'm sure I don't object to your being a mason; not at all, Caudle; I dare
say it's a very good thing; I dare say it is&mdash;it's only your making a
secret of it that vexes me. But you 'll tell me&mdash;you 'll tell your
own Margaret? You won't! You 're a wretch, Mr. Caudle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I know why: oh, yes, I can tell. The fact is, you're ashamed to let
me know what a fool they've been making of you. That's it. You, at your
time of life&mdash;the father of a family. I should be ashamed of myself,
Caudle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I suppose you'll be going to what you call your Lodge every night,
now. Lodge, indeed! Pretty place it must be, where they don't admit women.
Nice goings on, I dare say. Then you call one another brethren. Brethren!
I'm sure you'd relations enough; you didn't want any more.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I know what all this masonry's about. It's only an excuse to get away
from your wives and families, that you may feast and drink together,
that's all. That's the secret. And to abuse women,&mdash;as if they were
inferior animals, and not to be trusted. That's the secret; and nothing
else.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, Caudle, don't let us quarrel. Yes, I know you 're in pain. Still,
Caudle, my love; Caudle! Dearest, I say! Caudle! Caud&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I recollect nothing more,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;for here, thank Providence! I
fell asleep.&rdquo;

</div>
<p>
EM!&mdash;So, Mr. Caudle: I hope you enjoyed yourself at Greenwich. How do
I know you've been at Greenwich? I know it very well, sir: know all about
it: know more than you think I know. I thought there was something in the
wind. Yes; I was sure of it, when you went out of the house, to-day. I
knew it by the looks of you, though I didn't say anything. Upon my word!
And you call yourself a respectable man, and the father of a family! Going
to a fair amongst all sorts of people,&mdash;at your time of life. Yes;
and never think of taking your wife with you. Oh, no! you can go and enjoy
yourself out, with, <i>I</i> don't know who: go out, and make yourself
very pleasant, I dare say. Don't tell me; I hear what a nice companion Mr.
Caudle is: what a good-tempered person. Ha! I only wish people could see
you at home, that's all. But so it is with men. They can keep all their
good temper for out-of-doors&mdash;their wives never see any of it. Oh,
dear! I'm sure I don't know who'd be a poor woman!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, Caudle, I'm not in an ill temper: not at all. I know I used to be a
fool when we were first married: I used to worry and fret myself to death,
when you went out; but I've got over that. I wouldn't put myself out of
the way now for the best man that ever trod. For what thanks does a poor
woman get? None at all. No: it's those who don't care for their families,
who are the best thought of. I only wish I could bring myself not to care
for mine.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And why couldn't you say, like a man, you were going to Greenwich Fair,
when you went out? It's no use your saying that, Mr. Caudle: don't tell me
that you didn't think of going; you 'd made your mind up to it, and you
know it. Pretty games you've had, no doubt! I should like to have been
behind you, that's all. A man at your time of life!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I, of course, I never want to go out. Oh, no! I may stay at home with
the cat. You couldn't think of taking your wife and children, like any
other decent man, to a fair. Oh, no; you never care to be seen with us.
I'm sure, many people don't know you 're married: how can they? Your
wife's never seen with you. Oh, no; anybody but those belonging to you!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Greenwich Fair, indeed! Yes,&mdash;and of course you went up and down the
hill, running and racing with nobody knows who. Don't tell me; I know what
you are when you're out. You don't suppose, Mr. Caudle, I've forgotten
that pink bonnet, do you? No: I won't hold my tongue, and I'm not a
foolish woman. It's no matter, sir, if the pink bonnet was fifty years ago&mdash;it's
all the same for that. No: and if I live for fifty years to come, I never
will leave off talking of it. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Mr.
Caudle. Ha! few wives would have been what I've been to you. I only wish
my time was to come over again, that's all; I wouldn't be the fool I have
been.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Going to a fair! and I suppose you had your fortune told by the gypsies?
You needn't have wasted your money. I'm sure I can tell you your fortune
if you go on as you do. Yes, the gaol will be your fortune, Mr. Caudle.
And it would be no matter&mdash;none at all&mdash;if your wife and
children didn't suffer with you.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then you must go riding upon donkeys&mdash;you didn't go riding upon
donkeys? Yes; it's very well for you to say so; but I dare say you did. I
tell you, Caudle, I know what you are when you 're out. I wouldn't trust
any of you&mdash;you, especially, Caudle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then you must go in the thick of the fair, and have the girls scratching
your coat with rattles! You couldn't help it, if they did scratch your
coat? Don't tell me; people don't scratch coats unless they 're encouraged
to do it. And you must go in a swing, too. You didn't go in a swing? And
I'm a foolish woman to think so, am I? Well, if you didn't, it was no
fault of yours: you wished to go, I've no doubt.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then you must go into the shows? There,&mdash;you don't deny that.
You <i>did</i> go into a show. What of it, Mr. Caudle? A good deal of it,
sir. Nice crowding and squeezing in those shows, I know. Pretty places!
And you a married man and the father of a family. No: I won't hold my
tongue. It's very well for you to threaten to get up. You're to go to
Greenwich Fair, and race up and down the hill, and play at kiss in the
ring. Pah! it's disgusting, Mr. Caudle. Oh, I dare say you <i>did</i> play
at it; if you didn't, you'd have liked, and that's just as bad;&mdash;and
you can go into swings, and shows, and roundabouts. If I was you, I should
hide my head under the clothes, and be ashamed of myself.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what is most selfish&mdash;most mean of you, Caudle&mdash;you can go
and enjoy yourself, and never so much as bring home for the poor children
a gingerbread-nut. Don't tell me that your pocket was picked of a pound of
nuts! Nice company you must have been in to have your pocket picked.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I dare say I shall hear all about it tomorrow. I've no doubt, sir,
you were dancing at the Crown-and-Anchor. I should like to have seen you.
No: I'm not making myself ridiculous. It's you that's making yourself
ridiculous; and everybody that knows you says so. Everybody knows what I
have to put up with from you.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Going to a fair, indeed! At your time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;I dozed off, hearing confusedly the words&mdash;hill&mdash;gypsies&mdash;rattles&mdash;roundabout&mdash;swings&mdash;pink
bonnet&mdash;nuts.&rdquo;

<h2>
LECTURE X. ON MR. CAUDLE'S SHIRT-BUTTONS.
</h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE, Mr. Caudle, I hope you 're in a little better temper than you were
this morning? There&mdash;you needn't begin to whistle: people don't come
to bed to whistle. But it's like you. I can't speak, that you don't try to
insult me. Once, I used to say, you were the best creature living: now,
you get quite a fiend. <i>Do</i> let you rest? No: I won't let you rest.
It's the only time I have to talk to you, and you <i>shall</i> hear me.
I'm put upon all day long: it's very hard if I can't speak a word at
night; and it isn't often I open my mouth, goodness knows!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Because <i>once</i> in your lifetime your shirt wanted a button, you must
almost swear the roof off the house! You <i>didn't</i> swear? Ha, Mr.
Caudle! you don't know what you do when you 're in a passion. You were not
in a passion, wer'n't you? Well, then, I don't know what a passion is&mdash;and
I think I ought by this time. I've lived long enough with you, Mr. Caudle,
to know that.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;It's a pity you havn't something worse to complain of than a button off
your shirt. If you'd <i>some</i> wives, you would, I know. I'm sure I'm
never without a needle-and-thread in my hand. What with you and the
children, I'm made a perfect slave of. And what's my thanks? Why if once
in your life a button's off your shirt&mdash;what do you cry '<i>oh</i>'
at? I say once, Mr. Cau dle; or twice, or three times, at most. I'm sure,
Caudle, no man's buttons in the world are better looked after than your's.
I only wish I'd kept the shirts you had when you were first married! I
should like to know where were your buttons then?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it <i>is</i> worth talking of! But that's how you always try to put
me down. You fly into a rage, and then if I only try to speak, you won't
hear me. That's how you men always will have all the talk to yourselves: a
poor woman isn't allowed to get a word in.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A nice notion you have of a wife, to suppose she's nothing to think of
but her husband's buttons. A pretty notion, indeed, you have of marriage.
Ha! if poor women only knew what they had to go through! What with
buttons, and one thing and another! They'd never tie themselves up to the
best man in the world, I'm sure. What would they do, Mr. Caudle? Why, do
much better without you, I'm certain.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And it's my belief, after all, that the button wasn't off the shirt: it's
my belief that you pulled it off, that you might have something to talk
about. Oh, you 're aggravating enough, when you like, for anything! All I
know is, it's very odd that the button should be off the shirt; for I'm
sure no woman's a greater slave to her husband's buttons than I am. I only
say, it's very odd.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;However, there's one comfort; it can't last long. I'm worn to death with
your temper, and sha'n't trouble you a great while. Ha, you may laugh! And
I dare say you would laugh! I've no doubt of it! That's your love&mdash;that's
your feeling! I know that I'm sinking, every day, though I say nothing
about it. And when I'm gone, we shall see how your second wife will look
after your buttons! You 'll find out the difference, then. Yes, Caudle,
you 'll think of me, then: for then, I hope, you 'll never have a blessed
button to your back.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I'm not a vindictive woman, Mr. Caudle, nobody ever called me that,
but you. What do you say? Nobody ever knew so much of me? That's nothing;
at all to do with it. Ha! I wouldn't have your aggravating temper, Caudle,
for mines of gold. It's a good thing I'm not as worrying as you are&mdash;or
a nice house there'd be between us. I only wish you'd had a wife that <i>would</i>
have talked to you! then you 'd have known the difference. But you impose
upon me, because, like a poor fool, I say nothing. I should be ashamed of
myself, Caudle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And a pretty example you set as a father; You 'll make your boys as bad
as yourself. Talking as you did all breakfast-time about your but tons!
And of a Sunday morning too! And you call yourself a Christian! I should
like to know what your boys will say of you when they grow up? And all
about a paltry button off one of your wristbands: a decent man wouldn't
have mentioned it. Why won't I hold my tongue? Because I <i>won't</i> hold
my tongue. I'm to have my peace of mind destroyed&mdash;I'm to be worried
into my grave for a miserable shirt-button, and I'm to hold my tongue! Oh!
but that's just like you men!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But I know what I 'll do for the future. Every button you have may drop
off, and I won't so much as put a thread to 'em. And I should like to know
what you 'll do then? Oh, you must get somebody else to sew 'em, must you?
That's a pretty threat for a husband to hold out to a wife! And to such a
wife as I've been, too: such a negro-slave to your buttons, as I may say!
Somebody else to sew 'em, eh? No, Caudle, no: not while I'm alive! When
I'm dead&mdash;and with what I have to bear there's no knowing how soon
that may be&mdash;when I'm dead, I say&mdash;oh! what a brute you must be
to snore so!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You're not snoring? Ha! that's what you always say; but that's nothing to
do with it. You must get somebody else to sew 'em, must you? Ha! I
shouldn't wonder. Oh, no! I should be surprised at nothing, now! Nothing
at all! It's what people have always told me it would come to,&mdash;and
now, the buttons have opened my eyes! But the whole world shall know of
your cruelty, Mr. Caudle. After the wife I 've been to you. Somebody else,
indeed, to sew your buttons! I'm no longer to be mistress in my own house!
Ha, Caudle! I wouldn't have upon my conscience what you have, for the
world! I wouldn't treat anybody as you treat&mdash;no, I'm not mad! It's
you, Mr. Caudle, who are mad, or bad&mdash;and that's worse! I can't even
so much as, speak of a shirt-button, but that I'm threatened to be made
nobody of in my own house! Caudle, you've a heart like a hearth-stone, you
have! To threaten me, and only because a button&mdash;a button&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I was conscious of no more than this,&rdquo; says Caudle, in his MS., &ldquo;for here
nature relieved me with a sweet, deep sleep.&rdquo;

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>s your cold better tonight, Caudle? Yes, I thought it was. 'Twill be
quite well to-morrow, I dare say. There's a love! You don't take care
enough of yourself, Caudle, you don't. And you ought, I'm sure; if only
for my sake. For whatever I should do, if any thing was to happen to you&mdash;but
I won't think of it; no, I can't bear to think of <i>that</i>. Still, you
ought to take care of yourself; for you know you're not strong, Caudle;
you know you're not.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Wasn't dear mother so happy with us, tonight? Now, you needn't go to
sleep, so suddenly. I say, wasn't she so happy! <i>You don't know?</i> How
can you say you don't know? You must have seen it. But she always is
happier here than anywhere else. Ha! what a temper that dear soul has! I
call it a temper of satin; it is so smooth, so easy, and so soft. Nothing
puts her out of the way. And then, if you only knew how she takes your
part, Caudle! I'm sure, if you'd been her own son ten times over, she
couldn't be fonder of you. Don't you think so, Caudle? Eh, love? Now, do
answer. <i>How can you tell?</i> Nonsense, Caudle; you must have seen it.
I'm sure, nothing delights the dear soul so much as when she's thinking
how to please you.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Don't you remember Thursday night, the stewed oysters, when you came
home? That was all dear mother's doings! 'Margaret,' says she to me, 'it's
a cold night; and don't you think dear Mr. Caudle would like something
nice before he goes to bed? And that, Caudle, is how the oysters came
about. Now, don't sleep, Caudle: do listen to me, for five minutes;
'tisn't often I speak, goodness knows.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then, what a fuss she makes when you 're out, if your slippers arn't
put to the fire for you. <i>She's very good?</i> Yes&mdash;I know she is,
Caudle. And hasn't she been six months&mdash;though I promised her not to
tell you&mdash;six months, working a watch-pocket for you! And with <i>her</i>
eyes, dear soul&mdash;and at <i>her</i> time of life!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then what a cook she is? I'm sure, the dishes she'll make out of next
to nothing! I try hard enough to follow her: but I'm not ashamed to own
it, Caudle, she quite beats me. Ha! the many nice little things she'd
simmer up for you&mdash;and I can't do it; the children, you know it,
Caudle, take so much of my time. I can't do it, love: and I often reproach
myself that I can't. Now, you shan't go to sleep, Caudle; at least; not
for five minutes. You must hear me.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I've been thinking, dearest&mdash;ha! that nasty cough, love!&mdash;I've
been thinking, darling, if we could only persuade dear mother to come and
live with us. Now, Caudle, you can't be asleep; it's impossible&mdash;you
were coughing only this minute&mdash;yes, to live with us. What a treasure
we should have in her! Then, Caudle, you never need go to bed without
something nice and hot. And you want it, Caudle. <i>You don't want it?</i>
Nonsense, you do; for you're not strong, Caudle; you know you're not.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I'm sure, the money she'd save us in housekeeping. Ha! what an eye she
has for a joint! The butcher doesn't walk that could deceive dear mother.
And then, again, for poultry! What a finger and thumb she has for a
chicken! I never could market like her; it's a gift&mdash;quite a gift.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then you recollect her marrow-puddings? <i>You don't recollect 'em?</i>
Oh, fie! Caudle, how often have you flung her marrow-puddings in my face,
wanting to know why I couldn't make 'em? And I wouldn't pretend to do it
after dear mother. I should think it presumption. Now, love, if she was
only living with us&mdash;come, you 're not asleep, Caudle&mdash;if she
was only living with us, you could have marrow-puddings every day. Now,
don't fling yourself about and begin to swear at marrow-puddings; you know
you like 'em, dear.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;What a hand, too, dear mother has for a piecrust? But it's born with some
people. What do you say? <i>Why wasn't it born with me?</i> Now, Caudle,
that's cruel&mdash;unfeeling of you; I wouldn't have uttered such a
reproach to you for the whole world. People can't be born as they like.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;How often, too, have you wanted to brew at home! And I never could learn
any thing about brewing. But, ha! what ale dear mother makes! <i>You never
tasted it!</i> No, I know that. But I recollect the ale we used to have at
home: father never would drink wine after it. The best sherry was nothing
like it. <i>You dare say not?</i> No; it wasn't, indeed, Caudle. Then, if
dear mother was only with us, what money we should save in beer! And then
you might always have your own nice, pure, good, wholesome ale, Caudle:
and what good it would do you! For you're not strong, Caudle.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then dear mother's jams and preserves, love! I own it, Caudle; it has
often gone to my heart that with cold meat you hav'n't always had a
pudding. Now, if mother was with us, in the matter of fruit-puddings,
she'd make it summer all the year round. But I never could preserve&mdash;now
mother does it, and for next to no money whatever. What nice
dogs-in-a-blanket she'd make for the children! <i>What's
dogs-in-a-blanket?</i> Oh, they 're delicious&mdash;as dear mother makes
'em.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Now, you <i>have</i> tasted her Irish stew, Caudle? You remember that?
Come, you 're not asleep&mdash;you remember that? And how fond you are of
it! And I never can have it made to please you! Now what a relief to me it
would be if dear mother was always at hand that you might have a stew when
you liked. What a load it would be off my mind!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Again, for pickles! Not at all like anybody else's pickles. Her red
cabbage&mdash;why, it's as crisp as biscuit! And then her walnuts&mdash;and
her all-sorts? Eh, Caudle? You know how you love pickles; and how we
sometimes tiff about 'em? Now, if dear mother was here, a word would never
pass between us. And I'm sure nothing would make me happier, for&mdash;you
're not asleep, Caudle!&mdash;for I can't bear to quarrel, can I, love?
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;The children, too, are so fond of her! And she'd be such a help to me
with 'em! I'm sure with dear mother in the house, I shouldn't care a fig
for measles, or any thing of the sort. As a nurse, she's such a treasure!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And at her time of life, what a needlewoman! And the darning and mending
for the children, it really gets quite beyond me now, Caudle. Now with
mother at my hand, there wouldn't be a stitch wanted in the house.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And then when you're out late, Caudle&mdash;for I know you must be out
late, sometimes; I can't expect you, of course, to be always at home&mdash;why
then dear mother could sit up for you, and nothing would delight the dear
soul half so much.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And so, Caudle, love, I think dear mother had better come, don't you? Eh,
Caudle? Now, you 're not asleep, darling: don't you think she'd better
come? You say <i>No?</i> You say <i>No</i>, again? <i>You won't have her</i>,
you say; <i>You won't, that's flat?</i> Caudle&mdash;Cau-Cau-dle&mdash;Cau&mdash;die&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here Mrs. Caudle,&rdquo; says Mr. C., in his MS., &ldquo;suddenly went into tears;
and I went to sleep.&rdquo;

<h2>
LECTURE XII. MR. CAUDLE, HAVING COME HOME A LITTLE LATE, DECLARES THAT
HENCEFORTH &ldquo;HE WILL HAVE A DEAD-LATCH KEY.&rdquo;
 </h2>
<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N my word, Mr. Caudle, I think it a waste of time to come to bed at all
now! The cocks will be crowing in a minute. Keeping people up till past
twelve. Oh, yes! you 're thought a man of very fine feelings out of doors,
I dare say! It's a pity you haven't a little feeling for those belonging
to you at home. A nice hour to keep people out of their beds! <i>Why did I
sit up, then?</i> Because I chose to sit up&mdash;but that's my thanks.
No, it's no use your talking, Caudle; I never <i>will</i> let the girl sit
up for you, and there's an end. What do you say? <i>Why does she sit up
with me, then?</i> That's quite a different matter: you don't suppose I'm
going to sit up alone, do you? What do you say? <i>What's the use of two
sitting up?</i> That's my business. No, Caudle, it's no such thing. I <i>don't</i>
sit up because I may have the pleasure of talking about it; and you're an
ungrateful, unfeeling creature, to say so. I sit up because I choose it;
and if you don't come home all the night long&mdash;and 't will soon come
to that, I've no doubt&mdash;still, I'll never go to bed, so don't think
it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes! the time runs away very pleasantly with you men at your clubs&mdash;selfish
creatures! You can laugh and sing, and tell stories, and never think of
the clock; never think there's such a person as a wife belonging to you.
It's nothing to you that a poor woman's sitting up, and telling the
minutes, and seeing all sorts of things in the fire&mdash;and sometimes
thinking that something dreadful has happened to you&mdash;more fool she
to care a straw about you!&mdash;This is all nothing. Oh, no! when a
woman's once married she's a slave&mdash;worse than a slave&mdash;and must
bear it all!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what you men can find to talk about, I can't think! Instead of a man
sitting every night at home with his wife, and going to bed at a Christian
hour,&mdash;going to a club, to meet a set of people who don't care a
button for him, it 's monstrous! What do you say? <i>You only go once a
week?</i> That's nothing at all to do with it: you might as well go every
night; and I dare say you will soon. But if you do, you may get in as you
can: <i>I</i> won't sit up for you, I can tell you.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;My health's being destroyed night after night-and&mdash;oh, don't say
it's only once a week; I tell you, that's nothing to do with it&mdash;if
you had any eyes, you would see how ill I am; but you've no eyes for
anybody belonging to you: oh, no! your eyes are for people out of doors.
It's very well for you to call me a foolish, aggravating woman! I should
like to see the woman who'd sit up for you as I do. <i>You didn't want me
to sit up?</i> Yes, yes; that's your thanks&mdash;that's your gratitude:
I'm to ruin my health, and to be abused for it. Nice principles you've got
at that club, Mr. Caudle!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;But there's one comfort&mdash;one great comfort; it can't last long: I'm
sinking&mdash;I feel it, though I never say anything about it&mdash;but I
know my own feelings, and I say it can't last long. And then I should like
to know who 'll sit up for you! Then I should like to know how your second
wife&mdash;what do you say? <i>You'll never be troubled with another?</i>
Troubled, indeed! I never troubled you, Caudle. No; it's you've troubled
me; and you know it; though like a foolish woman I've borne it all, and
never said a word about it. But it <i>can't</i> last&mdash;that's one
blessing!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if a woman could only know what she'd have to suffer, before she was
married&mdash;Don't tell me you want to go to sleep! if you want to go to
sleep, you should come at proper hours! It's time to get up, for what I
know, now. Shouldn't wonder if you hear the milk in five minutes&mdash;there's
the sparrows up already; yes, I say the sparrows; and, Caudle, you ought
to blush to hear 'em. <i>You don't hear 'em?</i> Ha! you won't hear 'em,
you mean, <i>I</i> hear 'em. No, Mr. Caudle; it <i>isn't</i> the wind
whistling in the key-hole; I'm not quite foolish, though you may think so.
I hope I know wind from a sparrow!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Ha! when I think what a man you were before we were married! But you 're
now another person&mdash;quite an-altered creature. But I suppose you 're
all alike&mdash;I dare say, every poor woman's troubled and put upon,
though I should hope not so much as I am. Indeed, I should hope not! Going
and staying out, and&mdash;What! <i>You 'll have a dead-latch key?</i>
Will you? Not while I'm alive, Mr. Caudle. I'm not going to bed with the
door upon the latch for you or the best man breathing. <i>You won't have a
latch&mdash;you'll have a Chubb's lock?</i> Will you? I'll have no Chubb
here, I can tell you. What do you say? <i>You'll have the lock put on
to-morrow?</i> Well, try it; that's all I say, Caudle, try it. I won't let
you put me in a passion; but all I say is,&mdash;try it.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;A respectable thing, that, for a married man to carry about with him,&mdash;a
dead-latch key! That tells a tale, I think. A nice thing for the father of
a family! A key! What, to let yourself in and out when you please! To come
in, like a thief in the middle of the night, instead of knocking at the
door like a decent person! Oh, don't tell me that you only want to prevent
me sitting up,&mdash;if I choose to sit up, what's that to you? Some
wives, indeed, would make a noise about sitting up, but <i>you've</i> no
reason to complain, goodness knows!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Well, upon my word, I've lived to hear something. Carry the dead-latch
key about with you! I've heard of such things with young good-for-nothing
bachelors, with nobody to care what became of 'em; but for a married man
to leave his wife and children in the house with the door upon the latch&mdash;don't
talk to me about Chubb, it's all the same&mdash;a great deal you must care
for us. Yes, it's very well for you to say, that you only want the key for
peace and quietness&mdash;what's it to you, if I like to sit up? You've no
business to complain; it can't distress you. Now, it's no use your
talking; all I say is this, Caudle: if you send a man to put on any lock
here, I'll call in a policeman; as I'm your married wife, I will!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;No, I think when a man comes to have the dead-latch key, the sooner he
turns bachelor again the better. I'm sure, Caudle, I don't want to be any
clog upon you. Now, its no use your telling me to hold my tongue, for I&mdash;What?
I give you the head-ache, do I? No, I don't, Caudle: it's your club that
gives you the head-ache: it's your smoke, and your&mdash;well! if ever I
knew such a man in all my life! there's no saying a word to you! You go
out, and treat yourself like an emperor&mdash;and come home at twelve at
night, or any hour, for what I know,&mdash;and then you threaten to have a
key, and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;I <i>did</i> get to sleep at last,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;amidst the falling
sentences of 'take children into a lodging'&mdash;'separate maintenance'&mdash;'won't
be made a slave of'&mdash;and so forth.&rdquo;

<p class="pfirst"><span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t <i>is</i> hard, I think, Mr. Caudle, that I can't leave home for a day
or two, but the house must be turned into a tavern: a tavern?&mdash;a
pothouse! Yes, I thought you were very anxious that I should go; I thought
you wanted to get rid of me for something, or you would not have insisted
on my staying at dear mother's all night. You were afraid I should get
cold coming home, were you? Oh yes, you can be very tender, you can, Mr.
Caudle, when it suits your own purpose. Yes! and the world thinks what a
good husband you are! I only wish the world knew you as well as I do,
that's all; but it shall, some day, I'm determined.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;I 'm sure the house will not be sweet for a month. All the curtains are
poisoned with smoke; and, what's more, with the filthiest smoke I ever
knew. <i>Take 'em down, then?</i> Yes, it's all very well for you to say,
take 'em down; but they were only cleaned and put up a month ago; but a
careful wife's lost upon you, Mr. Caudle. You ought to have married
somebody who'd have let your house go to wreck and ruin, as I will for the
future. People who don't care for their families are better thought of
than those who do; I've long found out <i>that</i>.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And what a condition the carpet's in! They've taken five pounds out of
it, if a farthing, with their filthy boots, and I don't know what besides.
And then the smoke in the hearth-rug, and a large cinder-hole burnt in it!
I never saw such a house in <i>my</i> life! If you wanted to have a few
friends, why couldn't you invite 'em when your wife's at home, like any
other man? not have 'em sneaking in, like a set of housebreakers, directly
a woman turns her back. They must be pretty gentlemen, they must; mean
fellows, that are afraid to face a woman! Ha! and you all call yourselves
the lords of the creation! I should only like to see what would become of
the creation, if you were left to yourselves! A pretty pickle creation
would be in very soon!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;You must all have been in a nice condition! What do you say? <i>You took
nothing?</i> Took nothing, didn't you? I'm sure there's such a regiment of
empty bottles, I haven't had the heart to count 'em. And punch, too! you
must have punch! There's a hundred half-lemons in the kitchen, if there's
one: for Susan, like a good girl, kept 'em to show 'em me. No, sir; Susan
<i>shan't leave the house!</i> What do you say? <i>She has no right to
tell tales, and you will be master in your own house?</i> Will you? If you
don't alter, Mr. Caudle, you 'll soon have no house to be master of. A
whole loaf of sugar did I leave in the cupboard, and now there isn't as
much as would fill a tea-cup. Do you suppose I'm to find sugar for punch
for fifty men? What do you say? <i>There wasn't fifty?</i> That's no
matter; the more shame for 'em, sir. I'm sure they drank enough for fifty.
Do you suppose I'm to find sugar for punch for all the world out of my
housekeeping money? <i>You don't ask me?</i> Don't you ask me? You do; you
know you do: for if I only want a shilling extra, the house is in a blaze.
And yet a whole loaf of sugar can you throw away upon&mdash;&mdash; No, I
<i>won't</i> be still; and I <i>won't</i> let you go to sleep. If you'd
got to bed at a proper hour last night, you wouldn't have been so sleepy
now. You can sit up half the night with a pack of people who don't care
for you, and your poor wife can't get in a word!
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And there's that China image that I had when I was married&mdash;I
wouldn't have taken any sum of money for it, and you know it&mdash;and how
do I find it? With its precious head knocked off! And what was more mean,
more contemptible than all besides, it was put on again, as if nothing had
happened. <i>You knew nothing about it?</i> Now, how can you lie there, in
your Christian bed, Caudle, and say that? You know that that fellow,
Prettyman, knocked off the head with the poker! You know that he did. And
you hadn't the feeling?&mdash;yes, I will say it,&mdash;you hadn't the
feeling to protect what you knew was precious to me. Oh no, if the truth
was known, you were very glad to see it broken for that very reason.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Every way, I've been insulted. I should like to know who it was who
corked whiskers on my dear aunt's picture! Oh! you're laughing, are you?
<i>You 're not laughing?</i> Don't tell me that. I should like to know
what shakes the bed, then, if you 're not laughing? Yes, corked whiskers
on her dear face,&mdash;and she was a good soul to you, Caudle, and you
ought to be ashamed of yourself to see her ill-used. Oh, you may laugh!
It's very easy to laugh! I only wish you'd a little feeling, like other
people, that's all.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;Then there's my china mug&mdash;the mug I had before I was married&mdash;when
I was a happy creature. I should like to know who knocked the spout off
that mug? Don't tell me it was cracked before&mdash;it's no such thing,
Caudle; there wasn't a flaw in it&mdash;and now, I could have cried when I
saw it. Don't tell me it wasn't worth twopence. How do you know? You never
buy mugs. But that's like men; they think nothing in a house costs
anything.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;There's four glasses broke, and nine cracked. At least, that's all I've
found out at present; but I dare say I shall discover a dozen to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
&ldquo;And I should like to know where the cotton umbrella's gone to&mdash;and I
should like to know who broke the bell-pull&mdash;and perhaps you don't
know there's a leg off a chair,&mdash;and perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
 </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says Caudle, &ldquo;Morpheus came to my aid, and I slept; nay, I think I
snored.&rdquo;
